Initialize:
cnt = 6: A safety limit on the number of operations to prevent infinite loops, as the problem guarantees n * m â‰¤ 25.
f = 0: A flag to track if s is found as a substring in x.
res = 0: The number of operations performed.

The loop runs up to 6 times (cnt--):
x.find(s): Checks if s exists as a substring in x.
If found, set f = 1 and break the loop.

If not found:
Increment res (count the operation).
Append x to itself (x += x) to extend the string.

After the loop:
If f == 1 (substring s was found), output res (number of operations performed).
Otherwise, output -1 (indicating s cannot be made a substring).
