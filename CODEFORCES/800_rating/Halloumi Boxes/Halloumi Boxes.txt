If the array is already sorted or k>1
then there is always a way (reverse of size 2=swap consecutive elements).
Else it is not possible since when k=1 the array remains the same.


In C++, is_sorted() is a built-in function used to check whether
the element of the given range is sorted or not in ascending order.
