If the current cell is empty (.):
Increment cnt (count of consecutive empty cells).
Increment ans (place water in this cell using action 1).


If the current cell is blocked (#):
Reset cnt to 0 (consecutive streak ends).


If cnt >= 3 (more than 3 consecutive empty cells are encountered):
Stop the loop early since the propagation rules ensure that action 2 can take over.
