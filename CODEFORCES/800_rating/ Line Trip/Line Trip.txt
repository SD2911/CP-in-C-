Finding the Maximum Gap:
prev is initialized to 0, representing the starting position (point 0 on the number line).
ans keeps track of the maximum gap found so far.

The program loops through the array a:
It calculates the gap between the current position (a[i]) and the previous position(prev).
It updates ans to be the maximum of its current value and the newly calculated gap.
Updates prev to the current position (a[i]).

Handling the Last Segment:
After the loop, the program calculates the gap between the last position in a and the endpoint k.
This gap is doubled (2 * (k - prev)) because the journey needs to return back to the start.
